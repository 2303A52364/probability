        "A survey conducted by a local economics department claims that the average monthly cost of living for a single person in Hyderabad is ₹30,000. You want to test this claim using a sample of monthly living costs for 15 people in the city. You have collected this data as [25000, 31000, 20000, 28000, 29500, 32000, 21000, 30500, 27000, 28500, 30000, 23000, 31000, 26000, 29500]. Your goal is to determine whether the actual average cost of living is significantly different from the claimed value of ₹30,000.\n",
